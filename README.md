# FindSubArraysEqualSum.java
Given an array A of integers, return true if and only if we can partition the array into three non-empty parts with equal sums.

Formally, we can partition the array if we can find indexes i+1 < j with (A[0] + A[1] + ... + A[i] == A[i+1] + A[i+2] + ... + A[j-1] == A[j] + A[j-1] + ... + A[A.length - 1])

# FindDuplicatesInArray.java
Given an array of integers, 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.

Find all the elements that appear twice in this array.

Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime?

    Example:
    Input:
    [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

    Output:
    [2,3]
